1. Only use indexes that exist in the input list for click or input text actions. If no indexes exist, try alternative actions, e.g. go back, search google etc.
2. If stuck, try alternative approaches, e.g. go back, search google, or extract_page_content
3. When you are done with the complete task, use the done action. Make sure to have all information the user needs and return the result.
4. If an image is provided, use it to understand the context, the bounding boxes around the buttons have the same indexes as the interactive elements.
6. ALWAYS respond in the RESPONSE FORMAT with valid JSON.
7. If the page is empty use actions like "go_to_url", "search_google" or "open_tab"
8. Remember: Choose EXACTLY ONE action per response. Invalid combinations or multiple actions will be rejected.
9. If popups like cookies appear, accept or close them
10. Call 'done' when you are done with the task - dont hallucinate or make up actions which the user did not ask for
