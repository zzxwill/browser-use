# Here is the command to run the evaluation:
# python eval/service.py --parallel-runs 2 --max-steps 25 --start 0 --end 100 --model llama-4-maverick --eval-model gpt-4.1 --no-vision --eval-group "PRTests" --user-message "message here"

# This is the LLM as a judge evaluation system from the OSU-NLP Group paper
# Any adaptiations made should be explicitly stated here:
# Adaptations:
# We are using our langchain wrapper for the OpenAI API
# This means we changed model.generate to model.invoke. The behavior of the model should be identical.
# Added a Online_Mind2Web_eval_with_retry wrapper with retry logic in case of API rate limiting or other issues.

**Instructions**:
1. Provide a detailed description of the image, including its contents, visible elements, text (if any), and any notable features.

2. Carefully examine the image and evaluate whether it contains necessary steps or evidence crucial to task completion:  
- Identify key points that could be relevant to task completion, such as actions, progress indicators, tool usage, applied filters, or step-by-step instructions.  
- Does the image show actions, progress indicators, or critical information directly related to completing the task?  
- Is this information indispensable for understanding or ensuring task success?
- If the image contains partial but relevant information, consider its usefulness rather than dismissing it outright.

3. Provide your response in the following format:  
- **Reasoning**: Explain your thought process and observations. Mention specific elements in the image that indicate necessary steps, evidence, or lack thereof.  
- **Score**: Assign a score based on the reasoning, using the following scale:  
    - **1**: The image does not contain any necessary steps or relevant information.  
    - **2**: The image contains minimal or ambiguous information, unlikely to be essential.  
    - **3**: The image includes some relevant steps or hints but lacks clarity or completeness.  
    - **4**: The image contains important steps or evidence that are highly relevant but not fully comprehensive.

Given the user's task, the agent's action history, key points for task completion, some potentially important web pages in the agent's trajectory and their reasons, your goal is to determine whether the agent has completed the task and achieved all requirements.

Your response must strictly follow the following evaluation criteria!
*Important Evaluation Criteria*:
1: The filtered results must be displayed correctly. If filters were not properly applied (i.e., missing selection, missing confirmation, or no visible effect in results), the task is not considered successful.
2: You must carefully check whether these snapshots and action history meet these key points. Ensure that specific filter conditions, such as "best," "highest," "cheapest," "latest," "most recent," "lowest," "closest," "highest-rated," "largest," and "newest" are correctly applied using the filter function(e.g., sort function).
3: Certain key points or requirements should be applied by the filter. Otherwise, a search with all requirements as input will be deemed a failure since it cannot guarantee that all results meet the requirements!
4: If the task requires filtering by a specific range of money, years, or the number of beds and bathrooms, the applied filter must exactly match the given requirement. Any deviation results in failure. To ensure the task is successful, the applied filter must precisely match the specified range without being too broad or too narrow.
Examples of Failure Cases:
- If the requirement is less than $50, but the applied filter is less than $25, it is a failure.
- If the requirement is $1500-$2500, but the applied filter is $2000-$2500, it is a failure.
- If the requirement is $25-$200, but the applied filter is $0-$200, it is a failure.
- If the required years are 2004-2012, but the filter applied is 2001-2012, it is a failure.
- If the required years are before 2015, but the applied filter is 2000-2014, it is a failure.
- If the task requires exactly 2 beds, but the filter applied is 2+ beds, it is a failure.
5: Some tasks require a submission action or a display of results to be considered successful.
6: If the retrieved information is invalid or empty(e.g., No match was found), but the agent has correctly performed the required action, it should still be considered successful.
7: If the current page already displays all available items, then applying a filter is not necessary. As long as the agent selects items that meet the requirements (e.g., the cheapest or lowest price), the task is still considered successful.
