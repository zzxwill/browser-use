    attributes:
      label: "What is the problem that your feature request solves?"
      description: |
        Describe the problem or need that your feature request solves, include screenshots and example URLs if relevant.
      placeholder: |
        e.g. I need to be able to simulate dragging in a circle to test the paint feature on a drawing site: https://example.com/draw

      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: proposed_solution
    attributes:
      label: "What is your proposed solution?"
      description: |
        Describe the ideal specific solution you'd want, *and whether it fits into any broader scope of changes*.
      placeholder: |
        e.g. I want to add a default action that can hover/drag the mouse on a path when given a series
        of x,y coordinates. More broadly it may be useful add a computer-use/x,y-coordinate-style automation
        method fallback that can do complex mouse movements.

      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: workarounds_tried
    attributes:
      label: "What hacks or alternative solutions have you tried to solve the problem?"
      description: |
        A description of any troubleshooting, alternative approaches, workarounds, or other ideas you've considered to fix the problem.
      placeholder: |
        e.g. I tried upgrading to the latest version and telling it to hover in the prompt. I also tried 
        telling the agent to ask for human help (using a custom controller action) when it gets to this 
        step, then I manually click a browser extension in the navbar that automates the mouse movevement.
    validations:
      required: false

  - type: input
    id: version
    attributes:
      label: What version of browser-use are you currently using?
      description: |
        Run `pip show browser-use` or `git log -n 1` and share the exact number or git hash. DO NOT JUST ENTER `latest release` OR `main`.  
        We need to know what version of the browser-use library you're running in order to contextualize your feature request.  
        Sometimes features are already available and just need to be enabled with config on certain versions.
      placeholder: "e.g. 0.1.48 or 62760baaefd"

      required: true
