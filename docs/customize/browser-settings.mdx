Browser Use uses [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-persistent-context) (or [patchright](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright)) to manage its connection with a real browser.

```python
from browser_use import BrowserSession, BrowserProfile, Agent
```

**To launch a new browser**, pass any playwright args you want to use to `BrowserSession(...)`:

```python
new_browser = BrowserSession(user_data_dir='~/Desktop/test-profile', headless=False, ...)
agent = Agent('fill out the form on this page', browser_session=new_browser)
```
<Note>
  The new `BrowserSession` & `BrowserProfile` accept all the same arguments that Playwright's [`launch_persistent_context(...)`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-persistent-context) takes, giving you full control over browser settings at launch. (see below for the full list)
</Note>

**To connect to an existing remote browser**, initialize a `BrowserSession` with a `cdp_url`, `wss_url`, or `browser_pid`:

```python
remote_browser = BrowserSession(cdp_url='http://localhost:9222', keep_alive=True)
agent = Agent(task='Do some task with a remote browser...', browser_session=remote_browser)
agent = Agent(task='Other task reusing the same browser...', browser_session=remote_browser)
```

**To use Browser Use from an existing playwright script** you can also pass an existing `page`, `browser_context`, or `browser` playwright objects to `BrowserSession(...)`.

```python
browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(...)

page1 = await browser.new_page()
agent1 = Agent('Find the price for product abc', browser_session=BrowserSession(page=page1, keep_alive=True))

page2 = await browser.new_page()
agent2 = Agent('Find the price for product xyz', browser_session=BrowserSession(page=page2, keep_alive=True))

# the agents will share the existing browser and each work on different tabs ^
```

---

## `BrowserSession`

- `BrowserSession(**params)` is Browser Use's object that tracks a connection to a running browser. It sets up:
  - the `playwright`, `browser`, `browser_context`, and `page` objects and tracks which tabs the agent/human are focused on
  - methods to interact with the browser window, apply config needed by the Agent, and run the `DOMService` for element detection
  - it can take extra `**kwargs` to pass to playwright or a `browser_profile=BrowserProfile(...)` containing some config

### Browser Connection Parameters

Provide any one of these options to connect to an existing browser. These options are session-specific and cannot be stored in a `BrowserProfile(...)`.

#### `wss_url`

```python
wss_url: str | None = None
```

WSS URL of the playwright-protocol browser server to connect to. See here for [WSS connection instructions](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/real-browser#method-d%3A-connect-to-remote-playwright-node-js-browser-server-via-wss-url).

#### `cdp_url`

```python
cdp_url: str | None = None
```

CDP URL of the browser to connect to (e.g. `http://localhost:9222`). See here for [CDP connection instructions](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/real-browser#method-e%3A-connect-to-remote-browser-via-cdp-url).

#### `browser_pid`

```python
browser_pid: int | None = None
```

PID of a running chromium-based browser process to connect to on localhost. See here for [connection via pid](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/real-browser#method-c%3A-connect-to-local-browser-using-browser-pid) instructions.

<Note>
  For web scraping tasks on sites that restrict automated access, we recommend
  using [our cloud](https://browser-use.com) or an external browser provider for better reliability. 
  See the [Connect to your Browser](real-browser) guide for detailed connection instructions.
</Note>

### Session-Specific Parameters

#### `browser_profile`

```python
browser_profile: BrowserProfile = BrowserProfile()
```

Optional BrowserProfile instance containing config to use for the BrowserSession. (see below for more info)

#### `playwright`

```python
playwright: Playwright | None = None
```

Optional playwright or patchright API client object to use, the
result of `(await async_playwright().start())` or `(await async_patchright().start())`. See here for [more detailed usage instructions](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/real-browser#method-b%3A-connect-using-existing-playwright-objects).

#### `browser`

```python
browser: Browser | None = None
```

Playwright Browser object to use (optional). See here for [more detailed usage instructions](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/real-browser#method-b%3A-connect-using-existing-playwright-objects).

#### `browser_context`

```python
browser_context: BrowserContext | None = None
```

Playwright BrowserContext object to use (optional). See here for [more detailed usage instructions](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/real-browser#method-b%3A-connect-using-existing-playwright-objects).

#### `page` *aka* `agent_current_page`

<a name="page"></a><a name="agent-current-page"></a>

```python
page: Page | None = None
```

Foreground Page that the agent is focused on, can also be passed as `page=...` as a shortcut. See here for [more detailed usage instructions](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/real-browser#method-b%3A-connect-using-existing-playwright-objects).

#### `human_current_page`

```python
human_current_page: Page | None = None
```

Foreground Page that the human is focused on to start, usually not necessary to set manually.

#### `initialized`

```python
initialized: bool = False
```

Mark BrowserSession as already initialized, skips launch/connection (not recommended)


#### `**kwargs`

`BrowserSession` can also accept *all* of the parameters [below](#browserprofile).
(the parameters *above* this point are specific to `BrowserSession` and cannot be stored in a `BrowserProfile`)

---


## `BrowserProfile`

A `BrowserProfile` is an optional static collection of configuration that can be passed around and validated before it's used to start a `BrowserSession(browser_profile=BrowserProfile(...))`.

It can take all the same standard [playwright arguments](#playwright) that `BrowserSession(...)` takes, and some extras as well.

It allows you do do things like start multiple browsers with the same config easily:

```python
from browser_use.browser import BrowserProfile

browser_profile = BrowserProfile(headless=False, user_data_dir=None, allowed_domains=['https://*.example.com'], ...)

# start 3 separate browser instances with the same config options:
browser1 = BrowserSession(browser_profile=browser_profile, user_data_dir='/tmp/profile1')
browser2 = BrowserSession(browser_profile=browser_profile, user_data_dir='/tmp/profile2')
browser3 = BrowserSession(browser_profile=browser_profile, user_data_dir='/tmp/profile2')
```

### Browser-Use Parameters

These parameters control browser-use specific features, and are outside the standard playwright parameter set but are supported by both `BrowserSession` and `BrowserProfile`.

#### `keep_alive`

```python
keep_alive: bool | None = None
```

Keeps the browser alive after the agent has finished running. Useful for running multiple tasks with the same browser instance.

#### `allowed_domains`

```python
allowed_domains: list[str] | None = None
```

List of allowed domains for navigation. If None, all domains are allowed.
Example: `['google.com', '*.wikipedia.org']` - Here the agent will only be able to access `google.com` exactly and `wikipedia.org` + `*.wikipedia.org`.
  
Glob patterns are supported:
- `['example.com']` ✅ will match only `https://example.com/*` exactly, subdomains will not be allowed.
  It's always the most secure to list all the domains you want to give the access to explicitly w/ schemes e.g.
  `['*://google.com', 'http*://www.google.com', 'https://myaccount.google.com', 'https://mail.google.com', 'https://docs.google.com']`
- `['*.example.com']` ⚠️ **CAUTION** this will match `https://example.com` and *all* its subdomains.
  Make sure *all* the subdomains are safe for the agent! `abc.example.com`, `def.example.com`, ..., `useruploads.example.com`, `admin.example.com`

#### `disable_security`

```python
disable_security: bool = False
```

Completely disables all basic browser security features. Allows interacting across cross-site iFrames boundaries, but very INSECURE, don't visit untrusted URLs or use cookies.

#### `deterministic_rendering`

```python
deterministic_rendering: bool = False
```

Enable deterministic rendering flags for consistent screenshots.

#### `highlight_elements`

```python
highlight_elements: bool = True
```

Highlight interactive elements on the screen with colorful bounding boxes.

#### `viewport_expansion`

```python
viewport_expansion: int = 500
```

Viewport expansion in pixels. With this you can control how much of the page is included in the context of the LLM:
- `-1`: All elements from the entire page will be included, regardless of visibility (highest token usage but most complete).
- `0`: Only elements which are currently visible in the viewport will be included.
- `500` (default): Elements in the viewport plus an additional 500 pixels in each direction will be included, providing a balance between context and token usage.

#### `include_dynamic_attributes`

```python
include_dynamic_attributes: bool = True
```

Include dynamic attributes in selectors for better element targeting.

#### `minimum_wait_page_load_time`

```python
minimum_wait_page_load_time: float = 0.25
```

Minimum time to wait before capturing page state for LLM input.

#### `wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time`

```python
wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time: float = 0.5
```

Time to wait for network activity to cease. Increase to 3-5s for slower websites. This tracks essential content loading, not dynamic elements like videos.

#### `maximum_wait_page_load_time`

```python
maximum_wait_page_load_time: float = 5.0
```

Maximum time to wait for page load before proceeding.

#### `wait_between_actions`

```python
wait_between_actions: float = 0.5
```

Time to wait between agent actions.

#### `cookies_file`

```python
cookies_file: str | None = None
```

File to save cookies to.

#### `downloads_dir`

```python
downloads_dir: Path | str = '~/.config/browseruse/downloads'
```

#### `save_downloads_path`

```python
save_downloads_path: str | None = None
```

Directory for saving downloads (alternative to downloads_dir).

#### `profile_directory`

```python
profile_directory: str = 'Default'
```

Chrome profile directory name (e.g., 'Profile 1', 'Profile 2').

#### `window_position`

```python
window_position: dict | None = {"width": 0, "height": 0}
```

Window position from top-left corner.

#### `save_recording_path`

```python
save_recording_path: str | None = None
```

Directory path for saving video recordings.

#### `trace_path`

```python

### Playwright Launch Options


All the parameters below are standard playwright parameters and can be passed to both `BrowserSession` and `BrowserProfile`.
They are defined in `browser_use/browser/profile.py`. See here for the [official Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-persistent-context) for all of these options.

#### `headless`

```python
headless: bool | None = None
```

Runs the browser without a visible UI. If None, auto-detects based on display availability.

#### `channel`

```python
channel: BrowserChannel = 'chromium'
```

Browser channel: `'chromium'`, `'chrome'`, `'chrome-beta'`, `'chrome-dev'`, `'chrome-canary'`, `'msedge'`, `'msedge-beta'`, `'msedge-dev'`, `'msedge-canary'`

Don't worry, other chromium-based browsers not in this list (e.g. `brave`) are still supported if you provide your own [`executable_path`](#executable_path).

#### `executable_path`

```python
executable_path: str | Path | None = None
```

Path to browser executable for custom installations.

#### `user_data_dir`

```python
user_data_dir: str | Path | None = '~/.config/browseruse/profiles/default'
```

Directory for browser profile data. Set to `None` to use an ephemeral temporary profile (aka incognito mode).

Multiple running browsers **cannot share a single `user_data_dir` at the same time**. You must set it to `None` or
provide a unique `user_data_dir` per-session if you plan to run multiple browsers.

The browser version run must always be equal to or greater than the version used to create the `user_data_dir`.
If you see errors like `Failed to parse Extensions` or similar and failures when launching, you're attempting to run an older browser with an incompatible `user_data_dir` that's already been migrated to a newer schema version.

#### `args`

```python
args: list[str] = []
```

Additional command-line arguments to pass to the browser. See here for the [full list of available chrome launch options](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/).

#### `ignore_default_args`

```python
ignore_default_args: list[str] | bool = ['--enable-automation', '--disable-extensions']
```

#### `env`

```python
env: dict[str, str] = {}
```

Extra environment variables to set when launching browser. e.g. `{'DISPLAY': '1'}` to use a specific X11 display.

#### `chromium_sandbox`

```python
chromium_sandbox: bool = not IN_DOCKER
```

Whether to enable Chromium sandboxing (recommended for security). Should always be `False` when running inside Docker
because Docker provides its own sandboxing can conflict with Chrome's.

#### `devtools`

```python
devtools: bool = False
```

Whether to open DevTools panel automatically (only works when `headless=False`).

#### `slow_mo`

```python
slow_mo: float = 0
```

Slow down actions by this many milliseconds.

#### `timeout`

```python
timeout: float = 30000
```

Default timeout in milliseconds for connecting to a remote browser.

#### `accept_downloads`

```python
accept_downloads: bool = True
```

Whether to automatically accept all downloads.

#### `proxy`

```python
proxy: dict | None = None
```

Proxy settings. Example: `{"server": "http://proxy.com:8080", "username": "user", "password": "pass"}`. 

#### `permissions`

```python
permissions: list[str] = ['clipboard-read', 'clipboard-write', 'notifications']
```

Browser permissions to grant. See here for the [full list of available permission](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-grant-permissions).

#### `storage_state`

```python
storage_state: str | Path | dict | None = None
```

Browser storage state (cookies, localStorage). Can be file path or dict. See here for the [Playwright `storage_state` documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-storage-state) on how to use it.
This option is only applied when launching a new browser using the default builtin playwright chromium.



### Playwright Timing Settings

These control how the browser waits for CDP API calls to complete and pages to load.

#### `default_timeout`

```python
default_timeout: float | None = None
```

Default timeout for Playwright operations in milliseconds.

#### `default_navigation_timeout`

```python
default_navigation_timeout: float | None = None
```

Default timeout for page navigation in milliseconds.


### Playwright Viewport Options

Configure browser window size, viewport, and display properties:

#### `user_agent`

```python
user_agent: str | None = None
```

Specific user agent to use in this context.

#### `is_mobile`

```python

#### `has_touch`

```python
has_touch: bool = False
```

Specifies if viewport supports touch events.

```

Disable fixed viewport. Content will resize with window.

*Tip:* don't use this parameter, it's a playwright standard parameter but it's redundant and only serves to override the `viewport` setting above.
A viewport is *always* used in headless mode regardless of this setting, and is *never* used in headful mode unless you pass `viewport={width, height}` explicitly.

## Full Example

```python
from browser_use import BrowserSession, BrowserProfile, Agent

browser_profile = BrowserProfile(
    headless=False,
    cookies_file="path/to/cookies.json",
    wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time=3.0,
    viewport={"width": 1280, "height": 1100},
    locale='en-US',
    user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.102 Safari/537.36',
    highlight_elements=True,
    viewport_expansion=500,
    allowed_domains=['*.google.com', 'http*://*.wikipedia.org'],
    user_data_dir=None,
)

browser_session = BrowserSession(
    browser_profile=browser_profile,
    headless=True,                          # extra kwargs to the session override the defaults in the profile
)

# you can drive a session without the agent / reuse it between agents
await browser_session.start()
page = await browser_session.get_current_page()
await page.goto('https://example.com/first/page')

async def run_search():
    agent = Agent(
        task='Your task',
        llm=llm,
        page=page,                        # optional: pass a specific playwright page to start on
        browser_session=browser_session,  # optional: pass an existing browser session to an agent
    )
```

## Summary

- **BrowserSession** (defined in `browser_use/browser/session.py`) handles the live browser connection and runtime state
- **BrowserProfile** (defined in `browser_use/browser/profile.py`) can be used to store a collection of static configuration

Configuration parameters defined on either are consumed by these calls depending on whether we're connecting/launching:

- `BrowserConnectArgs` - args for `playwright.BrowserType.connect_over_cdp(...)`
- `BrowserLaunchArgs` - args for `playwright.BrowserType.launch(...)`
- `BrowserNewContextArgs` - args for `playwright.BrowserType.new_context(...)`
- `BrowserLaunchPersistentContextArgs` - args for `playwright.BrowserType.launch_persistent_context(...)`
- Browser Use's own internal methods

For more details on Playwright's browser context options, see the [official documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-persistent-context).
