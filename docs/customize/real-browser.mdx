## Overview

Browser Use supports a wide variety of ways to launch or connect to a browser:

- Launch a new local browser using playwright/patchright chromium (the default)
- Connect to a remote browser using CDP or WSS
- Use an existing playwright `Page`, `Browser`, or `BrowserContext` object
- Connect to a local browser already running using `browser_pid`

## Connection Methods

### Method A: Launch a New Local Browser (Default)

Launch a local browser using built-in default (playwright `chromium`) or a provided `executable_path`:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession

# If no executable_path provided, uses Playwright/Patchright's built-in Chromium
browser_session = BrowserSession(
    # Path to a specific Chromium-based executable (optional)
    executable_path='/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome',  # macOS
    # For Windows: 'C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe'
    # For Linux: '/usr/bin/google-chrome'
    
    # Use a specific data directory on disk (optional, set to None for incognito)
    user_data_dir='~/.config/browseruse/profiles/default',   # this is the default
    # ... any other BrowserProfile or playwright launch_persistnet_context config...
    # headless=False,
)

agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=llm,
    browser_session=browser_session,
)
```

We support most `chromium`-based browsers in `executable_path`, including [Brave](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/tree/main/examples/browser/stealth.py), [patchright chromium](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright), [rebrowser](https://rebrowser.net/), Edge, and more. See [`examples/browser/stealth.py`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/tree/main/examples/browser) for more. We do not support Firefox or Safari at the moment.

<Warning>
    [As of Chrome v136](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/1520), driving browsers with the default profile is [no longer supported](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port) for security reasons. Browser-Use has transitioned to creating a new dedicated profile for agents in: `~/.config/browseruse/profiles/default`. You can [open this profile](https://superuser.com/questions/377186/how-do-i-start-chrome-using-a-specified-user-profile) and log into everything you need your agent to have access to, and it will persist over time.
</Warning>

### Method B: Connect Using Existing Playwright Objects

Pass existing Playwright `Page`, `BrowserContext`, `Browser`, and/or `playwright` API object to `BrowserSession(...)`:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
# from patchright.async_api import async_playwright   # stealth alternative

async with async_playwright() as playwright:
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()
    context = await browser.new_context()
    page = await context.new_page()
    
    browser_session = BrowserSession(
        page=page,
        # browser_context=context,  # all these are supported
        # browser=browser,
        # playwright=playwright,
    )

    agent = Agent(
        task="Your task here",
        llm=llm,
        browser_session=browser_session,
    )
```

You can also pass `page` directly to `Agent(...)` as a shortcut.

```python
agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=llm,
    page=page,
)
```

### Method C: Connect to Local Browser Using Browser PID

Connect to a browser with open `--remote-debugging-port`:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession

# First, start Chrome with remote debugging:
# /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9242

# Then connect using the process ID
browser_session = BrowserSession(browser_pid=12345)  # Replace with actual Chrome PID

agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=llm,
    browser_session=browser_session,
)
```

### Method D: Connect to remote Playwright Node.js Browser Server via WSS URL

Connect to Playwright Node.js server providers:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession

# Connect to a playwright server
browser_session = BrowserSession(wss_url="wss://your-playwright-server.com/ws")

agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=llm,
    browser_session=browser_session,
)
```

### Method E: Connect to Remote Browser via CDP URL

Connect to any remote Chromium-based browser:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession

# Connect to Chrome via CDP
browser_session = BrowserSession(cdp_url="http://localhost:9222")

agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=llm,
    browser_session=browser_session,
)
```



## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  When using any browser profile, the agent will have access to:
  - All its logged-in sessions and cookies
  - Saved passwords (if autofill is enabled)
  - Browser history and bookmarks
  - Extensions and their data
  
  Always review the task you're giving to the agent and ensure it aligns with your security requirements!
  Use `Agent(sensitive_data={'https://auth.example.com': {x_key: value}})` for any secrets, and restrict the browser with `BrowserSession(allowed_domains=['https://*.example.com'])`.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Use isolated profiles**: Create separate Chrome profiles for different agents to limit scope of risk:
   ```python
   browser_session = BrowserSession(
       user_data_dir='~/.config/browseruse/profiles/banking',
       # profile_directory='Default'
   )
   ```

2. **Limit domain access**: Restrict which sites the agent can visit:
   ```python
   browser_session = BrowserSession(
       allowed_domains=['example.com', 'http*://*.github.com'],
   )
   ```

3. **Enable keep_alive for multiple tasks**: Keep the browser open between agent runs:
   ```python
   browser_session = BrowserSession(
       keep_alive=True,
       ...
   )
   ```

## Re-Using a Browser

A `BrowserSession` starts when the browser is launched/connected, and ends when the browser process exits/disconnects. A session internally manages a single live playwright browser context, and is normally auto-closed by the agent when its task is complete (*if* the agent started the session itself). If you pass an existing `BrowserSession` into an Agent, or if you set `BrowserSession(keep_alive=True)`, the session will not be closed and can be re-used between agents.

Browser Use provides a number of ways to re-use profiles, sessions, and other configuration across multiple agents.

- ✅ sequential agents can re-use a single `user_data_dir` in new `BrowserSession`s
- ✅ sequential agents can re-use a single `BrowserSession` without closing it
- ❌ parallel agents cannot run separate `BrowserSession`s using the same `user_data_dir`
- ✅ parallel agents can run separate `BrowserSession`s using the same `storage_state`
- ✅ parallel agents can share a single `BrowserSession`, working in different tabs
- ⚠️ parallel agents can share a single `BrowserSession`, working in the same tab

<Important>
Multiple `BrowserSession`s (aka chrome processes) cannot share the same `user_data_dir` at the same time, but they can share a `storage_state` file or `BrowserProfile` config.
</Important>

### Sequential Agents, Same Profile, Different Browser

If you are only running one agent & browser at a time, they can re-use the same `user_data_dir` sequentially.

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

reused_profile = BrowserProfile(user_data_dir='~/.config/browseruse/profiles/default')

agent1 = Agent(
    task="The first task...",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    browser_profile=reused_profile,    # pass the profile in, it will auto-create a session
)
await agent1.run()

agent2 = Agent(
    task="The second task...",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    browser_profile=reused_profile,    # agent will auto-create its own new session
)
await agent2.run()
```

> Make sure to never mix different browser versions or `executable_path`s with the same `user_data_dir`. Once run with a newer browser version, some migrations are applied to the dir and older browsers wont be able to read it.

### Sequential Agents, Same Profile, Same Browser

If you are only running one agent at a time, they can re-use the same active `BrowserSession` and avoid having to relaunch chrome.

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

reused_session = BrowserSession(
    user_data_dir='~/.config/browseruse/profiles/default',
    keep_alive=True,
)

agent1 = Agent(
    task="The first task...",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    browser_session=reused_session,              # pass the session in
)
await agent1.run()

agent2 = Agent(
    task="The second task...",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    browser_session=reused_session,              # re-use the same session
)
await agent2.run()

await reused_session.close()
```

### Parallel Agents, Same Browser, Multiple Tabs

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

shared_browser = BrowserSession(
    storage_state='/tmp/cookies.json',
    user_data_dir=None,
    keep_alive=True,
    headless=True,
)

agent1 = Agent(
    task="The first task...",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    browser_session=shared_browser,              # pass the session in
)
agent2 = Agent(
    task="The second task...",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    browser_session=shared_browser,              # re-use the same session
)
await asyncio.gather(agent1.run(), agent2.run()) # run in parallel

await shared_browser.close()
```

### Parallel Agents, Same Browser, Same Tab

<Warning>
⚠️ This mode is not recommended. Agents are not yet optimized to share the same tab in the same browser, they may interfere with each other or cause errors.
</Warning>


```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

playwright = await async_playwright().start()
browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(headless=True)
context = await browser.new_context()
shared_page = await context.new_page()
await shared_page.goto('https://example.com', wait_until='domcontentloaded')

agent1 = Agent(
    task="Fill out the form in section A...",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    page=shared_page,                              # pass the Page in
    # ^ shortcut for: browser_session=BrowserSession(page=page)
)
agent2 = Agent(
    task="Fill out the form in section B...",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    page=shared_page,                           # re-use the same Page
)
await asyncio.gather(agent1.run(), agent2.run()) # run in parallel

await browser.close()
```

### Parallel Agents, Same Profile, Different Browsers

<Tip>
This mode is the recommended default.
</Tip>

To share a single set of configuration or cookies, but still have agents working in their own browser sessions (potentially in parallel), use our provided `BrowserProfile` object.

The recommended way to re-use cookies and localStorage state between separate parallel sessions is to use the [`storage_state`](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/browser-settings#storage-state) option.

```bash
# open a browser to log into sites you want the Agent to have access to
playwright open https://example.com/ --save-storage=/tmp/auth.json
playwright open https://example.com/ --load-storage=/tmp/auth.json
```

```python
from browser_use.browser import BrowserProfile, BrowserSession

shared_profile = BrowserProfile(
    headless=True,
    user_data_dir=None,               # use dedicated tmp user_data_dir per session
    storage_state='/tmp/auth.json',   # load/save cookies to/from json file
    keep_alive=True,                  # don't close the browser after the agent finishes
)

window1 = BrowserSession(browser_profile=profile_a)
agent1 = Agent(browser_session=window1)

window2 = BrowserSession(browser_profile=profile_a)
agent2 = Agent(browser_session=window2)

await asyncio.gather(agent1.run(), agent2.run())  # run in parallel
await window1.save_cookies()  # write cookie updates to auth.json
await window2.save_cookies()  # you must decide when to save manually

# can also reload the cookies from the file into the active session if they change
await window1.load_cookies_from_file()
await window1.close()
await window2.close()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome Won't Connect

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. **Close all Chrome instances** before trying to launch with a custom profile
2. **Check if Chrome is running with debugging port**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep chrome | grep remote-debugging-port
   ```
3. **Verify the executable path** is correct for your system
4. **Check profile permissions** - ensure your user has read/write access

### Profile Lock Issues

If you get a "profile is already in use" error:

1. Close all Chrome instances
2. The profile will automatically be unlocked when BrowserSession starts
3. Alternatively, manually delete the `SingletonLock` file in the profile directory

<Note>
  For more configuration options, see the [Browser Settings](/customize/browser-settings) documentation.
</Note>

### Profile Version Issues

The browser version you run must always be equal to or greater than the version used to create the `user_data_dir`.
If you see errors like `Failed to parse Extensions` when launching, you're likely attempting to run an older browser with an incompatible `user_data_dir` that's already been migrated to a newer Chrome version.

Playwright ships a version of chromium that's newer than the default stable Google Chrome release channel, so this can happen if you try to use
a profile created by the default playwright chromium (e.g. `user_data_dir='~/.config/browseruse/profiles/default'`) with an older
local browser like `executable_path='/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome'`.
