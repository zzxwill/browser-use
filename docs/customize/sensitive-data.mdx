## Handling Sensitive Data

When working with sensitive information like passwords, you can use the `sensitive_data` parameter to prevent the model from seeing the actual values while still allowing it to reference them in its actions.

Make sure to always set [`allowed_domains`](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/browser-settings#restrict-urls) to restrict the domains the Agent is allowed to visit when working with sensitive data or logins.

Here's an example of how to use sensitive data:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent

load_dotenv()

# Initialize the model
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model='gpt-4o',
    temperature=0.0,
)

# Define sensitive data
# The model will only see the keys (x_name, x_password) but never the actual values
sensitive_data = {'x_name': 'magnus', 'x_password': '12345678'}

# Use the placeholder names in your task description
task = 'go to x.com and login with x_name and x_password then write a post about the meaning of life'

# Pass the sensitive data to the agent
agent = Agent(
    task=task,
    llm=llm,
    sensitive_data=sensitive_data,
    browser=Browser(
        config=BrowserConfig(
            allowed_domains=['example.com'],  # domains that the agent should be restricted to
        ),
    )
)

async def main():
    await agent.run()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example:
1. The model only sees `x_name` and `x_password` as placeholders.
2. When the model wants to use your password it outputs x_password - and we replace it with the actual value.
3. When your password is visible on the current page, we replace it in the LLM input - so that the model never has it in its state.
4. The agent will be prevented from going to any site not on `example.com` to protect from prompt injection attacks and jailbreaks

### Missing or Empty Values

When working with sensitive data, keep these details in mind:

- If a key referenced by the model (`<secret>key_name</secret>`) is missing from your `sensitive_data` dictionary, a warning will be logged but the substitution tag will be preserved.
- If you provide an empty value for a key in the `sensitive_data` dictionary, it will be treated the same as a missing key.
- The system will always attempt to process all valid substitutions, even if some keys are missing or empty.

Warning: Vision models still see the image of the page - where the sensitive data might be visible.

This approach ensures that sensitive information remains secure while still allowing the agent to perform tasks that require authentication.
