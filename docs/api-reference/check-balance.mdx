## API Credit Usage

Each task execution consumes API credits based on the following factors:

1. **Task Duration**: Longer running tasks consume more credits
2. **LLM Model**: More powerful models consume more credits
3. **Browser Features**: Features like proxy usage and adblock may affect credit consumption
4. **Task Complexity**: More complex tasks with many steps consume more credits

You can monitor your credit usage through the [Browser Use Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.browser-use.com/dashboard) or by using the Check Balance endpoint.

<Note>
  If your balance reaches zero, new task executions will be rejected until you
  add more credits or your subscription renews.
