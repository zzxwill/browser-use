Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about events in your Browser Use tasks. This guide will show you how to set up and verify webhook endpoints.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  You need an active subscription to create webhooks. See your billing page
  [cloud.browser-use.com/billing](https://cloud.browser-use.com/billing)
</Note>

## Setting Up Webhooks

To receive webhook notifications, you need to:

1. Create an endpoint that can receive HTTPS POST requests
2. Configure your webhook URL in the Browser Use dashboard
3. Implement signature verification to ensure webhook authenticity

<Note>
  When adding a webhook URL in the dashboard, it must be a valid HTTPS URL that can receive POST requests. 
  On creation, we will send a test payload `{"test": "ok"}` to verify the endpoint is working correctly before creating the actual webhook!
</Note>

## Webhook Events

Browser Use currently only sends status updates for your running tasks:

| Status         | Description                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `initializing` | A task is initializing                 |
| `started`      | A Task has started (browser available) |
| `paused`       | A task has been paused mid execution   |
| `stopped`      | A task has been stopped mid execution  |
| `finished`     | A task has finished                    |

## Webhook Payload

Each webhook call includes:

- A JSON payload with event details
- `X-Browser-Use-Timestamp` header with the current timestamp
- `X-Browser-Use-Signature` header for verification

Example payload:

```json
{
  "session_id": "602c8809-61ee-461d-acfd-3e8783f23326",
  "task_id": "b9792a06-0411-4838-96de-c720f34206a2",
  "status": "initializing"
}
```

## Implementing Webhook Verification

To ensure webhook authenticity, you must verify the signature. Here's an example implementation in Python using FastAPI:

```python
import uvicorn
import hmac
import hashlib
import json
import os

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException

app = FastAPI()

SECRET_KEY = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']

def verify_signature(payload: dict, timestamp: str, received_signature: str) -> bool:
    message = f'{timestamp}.{json.dumps(payload, separators=(",", ":"), sort_keys=True)}'
    expected_signature = hmac.new(SECRET_KEY.encode(), message.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, received_signature)

@app.post('/webhook')
async def webhook(request: Request):
    body = await request.json()

    timestamp = request.headers.get('X-Browser-Use-Timestamp')
    signature = request.headers.get('X-Browser-Use-Signature')
    if not timestamp or not signature:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail='Missing timestamp or signature')

    if not verify_signature(body, timestamp, signature):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail='Invalid signature')

    print('Valid webhook call received:', body)
    return {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Webhook received'}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvicorn.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify signatures**: Never process webhook payloads without verifying the signature
2. **Handle retries**: Browser Use will retry failed webhook deliveries up to 5 times
3. **Respond quickly**: Return a 200 response as soon as you've verified the signature
4. **Process asynchronously**: Handle the webhook payload processing in a background task
5. **Monitor failures**: Set up monitoring for webhook delivery failures
