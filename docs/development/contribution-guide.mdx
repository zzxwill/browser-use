## How to Contribute

### Find Something to Work On

- Browse our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) for beginner-friendly issues labeled `#help wanted` or `#good first issue`
- Check out our most active issues or ask in [Discord](https://link.browser-use.com/discord) for ideas of what to work on
- Get inspiration and share what you build in the [`#showcase-your-work`](https://discord.com/channels/1303749220842340412/1305549200678850642) channel
- Explore or contribute to [`browser-use/awesome-prompts`](https://github.com/browser-use/awesome-prompts)!

### The Contribution Process


1. Create a [new issue](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues) and describe your desired change, or comment on an existing issue that you want to work on
2. Create a new [**`Draft` Pull Request**](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-draft-pull-requests/) *immediately* when you start work, and push your commits as you go, don't wait until you finish to open a PR!
    - we won't review `Draft` pull requests until you mark them as [`[Ready for Review]`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests)
    - tests & linter don't have to pass for every single draft commit, we only care about final commit when marked ready to review
    - draft PRs allow us to provide feedback & guidance on direction *before* you invest a ton of time making a perfect PR
    - draft PRs allow others to see your work-in-progress + help test and share comments / avoid merge conflicts with their own work
3. Once it's ready for review and all the CI tests and linters pass, mark it [`[Ready for Review]`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request)
4. Someone on our team will take a look and merge it or ask for changes
    - small PRs are often reviewed and merged hours of being opened! (the smaller your PR is the faster we can merge it)
    - large PRs may take days to ~weeks to review and merge
    - if you don't get a response within a week, ping `@pirate` or another team member to bump it in our queue


> [!NOTE]
> If it's a very small bugfix or `<20` line change, you can skip some of these steps, use your best judgement.


### How We Prioritize PRs


> [!TIP]
>
> - 👍 we like PRs for any issue marked [`#help wanted`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) or [`#good first issue`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22)
> - 👍 we like PRs that include one or more screenrecordings of the agent running on different sites
> - 👍 we like small `<50` line PRs that focus on a single bugfix, feature, or refactored function

> [!WARNING]
- 👎 we deprioritize PRs that don't include a screenrecording/gif/screenshot proof of the new feature working when run
- 👎 we deprioritize PRs that dont include a test in `tests/ci/test_....py` covering all new code paths
- 👎 we deprioritize PRs that change the default actions / system prompt without evidence that you have spot checked it on a range of real-world tasks

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> - ❌ we reject typo/style-only PRs, only touch existing code if you are already changing it as part of a bugfix or new feature!
> - ❌ we reject `>200`-line sprawling PRs with mixtures of new features and random bugfixes / refactoring, split it up into separate bugfix and new feature PRs!
> - ❌ we reject any PRs that lower our real-world eval scores (visible only to us, we will comment if this is the case)



### Contribution Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix, open a draft PR on our repo for it
3. Make your changes and push commits to your draft PR periodically
4. Run `./bin/tests.sh` and `./bin/lint.sh` to ensure everything works
5. Mark your PR "Ready for Review"
6. Respond to any feedback from maintainers, wait for it to be merged
7. Celebrate your contribution on Discord/X/Linkedin!

> [!TIP]
> **If your PR or issue doesn't get a response within a week:**  
> 
> Break your PR up into smaller PRs and submit them individually, or @mention `@pirate` or the last person who touched the code to ping them for a response.
