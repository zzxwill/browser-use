Test script for BrowserSession.start() method to ensure proper initialization,
concurrency handling, and error handling.

Tests cover:
- Calling .start() on a session that's already started
- Simultaneously calling .start() from two parallel coroutines
- Calling .start() on a session that's started but has a closed browser connection
- Calling .close() on a session that hasn't been started yet
